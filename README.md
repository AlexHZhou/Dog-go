# Dog-go - a productivity and fitness app for doggo lovers.

## General
### About: 
Dog-go is a productivity app based around your virtual dog. You have to keep your dog happy by completing goals that you set for yourself, so they could be anything from "walking 1 mile a day" to "finishing homework before 10pm". Finishing goals gives you treats or toys, which are used to feed or play with your dog. There is a streak incentive to keep up on finishing your daily goals.
### Tech Stack: 
React, React Native, Expo, AsyncStorage

## Screens:
### Screen 1: Home
Shows your doggo and information about his current hunger and happiness level. Over time he will get hungry and bored so you can feed your doggo with treats and entertain him with tennis balls. Dogecoin is a depreciated currency and has no functionality.

### Screen 2: Goals
This is where you see and submit your goals. Goals are honor-based because they can be literally anything: each goal is submitted by the user themselves. Each day, you can 'finish' up to two goals, recieving treats or tennis balls depending on which goal. Eventually you can build up a goal streak over time but missing a day will reset the streak.

### Screen 3: Settings
In the settings screen you can customize your goals. The dev version (which also happens to be the default version) contains a handy reset button. In production is a button that can fast forwards time (to check the streaks functionality) but the technology is not there yet.
